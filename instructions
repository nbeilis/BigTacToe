Hey there partner!
To play this game, you can either play with another person (2-Player Game) or against a computer (1-Player Game)!
Big-Tac-Toe takes place on a big three-by-three grid, where each large section further has a smaller three-by-three grid. 

The goal of Big-Tac-Toe is to win three large sections in a row (diagonally, horizontally, vertically). 

Players take turns clicking on an empty and viable space to designate that they have chosen the spot.

Rules:
1. For the first move, the first player can choose a spot in any section
2. The following player MUST play within the large section that corresponds to the small spot the previous player went in. This applies for all players immediately after the first move.
3. If a player is sent to a filled section or a section with a winner, since no one can play in that section, the player sent there can go anywhere.
4. To win a large section, a player must win a small game of tic-tac-toe by getting three of their pieces in a row (diagonally, horizontally, vertically)
5. The player who wins three in a row of the large sections wins the overall game.
...and the last rule is to have fun! :D
